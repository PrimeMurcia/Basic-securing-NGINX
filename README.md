   sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```

   ```bash
   http {
    ...
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'";
    server_token off;
    ...
   }
   ```
